        <p>Alhamdulillah, Nahmaduhu, wa nasta`eenuh, wa nastagfiruh, wa na`udhu billah min shuruuri anfusina, wa min sayyiaati a`amaalina, man yahdihillahu fala mudilla lah, wa man yudlilhu fala haadiya lah, I testify that There is No God except Allah, He is One, without any Partners, the Worthy of Worship, and I testify the Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, is the Rasool of Allah, and his slave and there is no Prophet after him. To Proceed, I made this website to share the knowledge which Allah subhaanahu wa ta'aala blessed me with, and also the knowledge of other Muslims. I believe in living the practical Life on the guidelines and laws Allah gave us, and upon the Sunnah of his Prophets, alayhim as-salaam, whom He sent with truth. I do not like to perceive Islam, the religion of Truth, as Topic of Un-necessary Theoretical Discussions bound within books and it's shelves. The Deen of Allah is a serious Deen, which requires us to believe firmly, to gain knowledge about it, act upon that knowledge (which is most important) , spread the knowledge & invite others to it. And hence, I will, in sha Allah, discuss about only those Topics which are beneficial. </p>

            Note: Everything I post whether texts, audios or videos can be published and used elsewhere without asking me and this is For All Muslims, and I want no credits or mentions.
